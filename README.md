The meeting minutes from the Joint Rental-Finance Committee on July 18, 2024, suggest several key initiatives and strategic directions for the company, particularly in relation to rent and parking increases for 2025. Here's a summary based on the company's initiatives:

Rent Increases: The committee discussed and recommended a 2.5% rent increase for current tenants, in line with the Rent Review Guideline set by the province of Ontario. Although the organization is exempt from this guideline, they have chosen to follow it to date. However, there is a recognition that this guideline may not keep pace with inflation, which could impact the organization's financial viability. Therefore, this decision reflects a cautious approach, balancing tenant affordability with the need to generate sufficient revenue to maintain and improve the housing stock​(Rental-Finance Committe…).

Parking Fee Increases: The committee recommended a $5 increase in parking fees for 2025, excluding the Beaver Barracks property. This decision was made after considering that the current parking fees are low compared to privately-owned lots, and the need to generate additional revenue from parking, which is a significant income stream. The discussion also included future plans to simplify parking rates across properties and potentially align them with the rates at Beaver Barracks by 2026 or 2027​(Rental-Finance Committe…).

Turnover Rents: For new tenants moving in during 2025, the committee recommended increasing turnover rents by about 4% over 2024 levels. This decision was made to keep rents below the city-wide average market rents (AMR) while also reflecting the financial realities of maintaining affordable housing. The increase is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the organization remains financially sustainable while continuing to fulfill its mission of providing housing for low- and moderate-income people​(Rental-Finance Committe…).

Overall, the meeting reflects a careful balancing of financial sustainability with the organization’s mission, with a clear focus on maintaining affordability while also planning for long-term capital needs and operational efficiencies.
